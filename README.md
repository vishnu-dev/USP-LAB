# USP-LAB

##### List of Experiments for USP: 
Design, develop, and execute the following programs 

1. Write a C/C++ POSIX compliant program to check the following limits: 
(i)  No.  of  clock  ticks  
(ii)  Max.  no.  of  child  processes  
(iii)  Max.  path  length  
(iv)  Max.  no.  of characters in a file name 
(v) Max. no. of open files/ process  

2. Write a C/C++ POSIX compliant program that prints the POSIX defined configuration options 
supported on any given system using feature test macros. 

3. Consider the last 100 bytes as a region. Write a C/C++ program to check whether the region is 
locked or not.  If the region is locked, print pid of the process which has locked. If the region is 
not locked, lock the region with an exclusive lock, read the last 50 bytes and unlock the region. 

4.  Write  a  C/C++  program  which  demonstrates  interprocess  communication  between  a  reader 
process and a writer process. Use mkfifo, open, read, write and close APIs in your program. 

5. a) Write a C/C++ program that outputs the contents of its Environment list 
    b) Write a C / C++ program to emulate the unix ln command
    
6. Write a C/C++ program to illustrate the race condition. 

7.  Write  a  C/C++  program  that  creates  a  zombie  and  then  calls  system  to  execute  the ps command to verify that the process is zombie. 

8. Write a C/C++ program to avoid zombie process by forking twice. 

9. Write a C/C++ program to implement the system function.  

10. Write a C/C++ program to set up a real-time clock interval timer using the alarm API. 

##### List  of  Experiments  for  Compiler  Design: 
Design,  develop,  and  execute  the  following 
programs. 

11.  Write  a  C  program  to  implement  the  syntax-directed definition of “if E then S1” and “if E then  S1  else  S2”. 

12. Write a yacc program that accepts a regular expression as input and produce its parse tree as output.
